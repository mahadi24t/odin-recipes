    <h1>Best Potatoes for Mashed Potatoes</h1>

    <p>
        The best potatoes for mashing depends on your personal preference, as some varieties will give you fluffy results while others will give you creamy results.
    </p>

    <p>
        This recipe calls for baking potatoes (a.k.a. russets), which are ideal for light and fluffy mashed potatoes. A good all-purpose potato, such as Yukon Gold, is also always a crowd-pleaser.

    <p>"Oh my word," says Cheryl Gillam. "This is so easy!! Thank you for posting this recipe. I will be heating the milk and butter separately from now on. Who knew a simple thing like that would make all the difference?"</p>

    <p>
        "My kids devour these when I make them," according to one Allrecipes community member. "I beat an egg into the potatoes, and it makes them taste richer and creamier."
    </p>

    <p>
        "The best I've ever made!" raves Kate Rigatuso. "I did the recipe as-is, but mixed them and the melted butter and milk in a stand mixer, and the consistency is perfect - light and fluffy!"
